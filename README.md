Implementation of a Rest Client In Codesys with Basic Auth

This is an implemetation of a Rest Client in codesys on a PLC. The implemetation uses basic Authorization for the client to access resource on the API server 

I worked with a TURCK Q300 CDS PLC but can work with any PLC running Codesys V3.5 SP14 patch 2 or later. 

## Prerequisites
- You will need to install the HTTPClient Library. Can be found here: https://forge.codesys.com/prj/codesys-example/http-client-exa/home/Home/

## Usage
- The program has been implemented in Codesys V3.5 SP19
- However a Codesys V3.5 SP14 patch 2 has also been saved in this repo. So it will work with any Codesys V3.5 SP14 patch 2 or later
- Just Downlad the ```.project``` files and open as a codesys project

## Demo
- You can find a Video Demo on [how to implement Rest Client Codesys Here](https://youtu.be/Ibu4_FHtIHk)
